# Landing Page Project

This is a simple project to display an interactive Landing Page demo. The page builds a navigation bar dynamically. There is also a 2-way correspondence between the page and the navigation bar, implemented using IntersectionObserver API:
1. When you click/tap an item on navbar, it scrolls to the section. 
2. Similarly, when you scroll to a particular section on the page, it highlights the section on the navbar.
